## TODO: make a script that does all this (if possible)

1. Turn off natural scrolling (so that it's not inverted) by going into Settings > Trackpad > Scroll & Zoom > Natural Scrolling is OFF
2. Copy local.removecapslockdelay.plist into /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or ~/Library/LaunchAgents/. If neither of those folders exist, create them - https://github.com/gkpln3/CapsLockNoDelay/issues/22#issuecomment-2594362547
3. Install Brave - https://brave.com/download/
4. Install Mos for mouse smooth scrolling - https://github.com/Caldis/Mos/blob/master/README.enUS.md
5. Install Karabiner elements for key remapping to Windows/Linux style - https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/
6. Install Windows key remaps for Karabiner by opening a new tab in putting into the URL bar: `karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vorpal56/karabiner-windows-mode/refs/heads/main/json/windows_shortcuts.json`
